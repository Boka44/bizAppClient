# BizAppClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## The test: 

Develop a website for trading where the traders can either sign up or sign in and they 
should be navigated to the dashboard screen. Traders can mark the stocks as favourites by 
searching them. All the user favourites stocks are shown in the dashboard.

The client can be found here at [https://github.com/Boka44/bizAppServer](https://github.com/Boka44/bizAppServer)
